# MiniBank

In this project i made a minibank which provides the user with options such as depositing, withdrawing and transfering money. 
The minibank is accessed entirely by using a CLI in a java IDE (prefereably Eclipse).

The project was completed as a final school project in a course about Distributed Systems, late 2017.
